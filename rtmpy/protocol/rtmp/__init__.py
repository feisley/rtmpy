RTMP implementation.

The Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is a protocol that is primarily used
to stream audio and video over the internet to the U{Adobe Flash Player<http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Player>}.

The protocol is a container for data packets which may be U{AMF<http://osflash
.org/documentation/amf>} or raw audio/video data like found in U{FLV<http://
osflash.org/flv>}. A single connection is capable of multiplexing many
NetStreams using different channels. Within these channels packets are split up
into fixed size body chunks.
